# Elixir Standard Library Helpers

#### Why? I want to use the same API on the front and back end while being immutable


See [history.md](https://github.com/AdamBrodzinski/elixir-stdlib-js/blob/master/history.md) for changes and updates

# Dev Commands
- `npm run clean` - Remove `lib/` directory
- `npm test` - Run tests. Tests can be written with ES6 (WOW!)
- `npm test:watch` - You can even re-run tests on file changes!
- `npm run cover` - Yes. You can even cover ES6 code.
- `npm run lint` - We recommend using [airbnb-config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb). It's fantastic.
- `npm run test:examples` - We recommend writing examples on pure JS for better understanding module usage.
- `npm run build` - Do some magic with ES6 to create ES5 code.
- `npm run prepublish` - Hook for npm. Do all the checks before publishing you module.
